# Commands that you don't want running as root would be invoked
# with: sudo -u $real_user
# So they will be run as the user who invoked the sudo command
# Keep in mind if the user is using a root shell (they're logged in as root),
# then $real_user is actually root
# sudo -u $real_user non-root-command

# Commands that need to be ran with root would be invoked without sudo
